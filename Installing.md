# Installing and configuring ROS on the Raspberry Pi

Ubuntu MATE 16.04 (Xenial) and ROS Kinetic are used to ensure compatibility for when a pi-gen script will be used to create the images. Currently, pi-gen does not support Ubuntu Bionic, required for ROS Melodic. 

## Installing Ubuntu MATE 16.04

Ubuntu MATE 16.04 should be downloaded and installed on the Raspberry Pi.

## Installing ROS Kinetic

The procedure followed to install packages was from <http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu>
Select the "Desktop Install" for the set of packages at step 1.4.
This might take some time (10-20 minutes or more) on the Raspberry Pi, since there is a lot of disk I/O.
